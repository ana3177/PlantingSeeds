Critical Interventions to improve the waiting experience in correctional facilities

This resource is open for anyone to use. Take it, try it, change it, let it grow.  


This project was originally created for a service design course (DSGN 401-3) at Northwestern with help from Laundry Cares, The Women's Justice Institute (WJI), and Becca's Place at the Cook County DOC (CCDOC).
